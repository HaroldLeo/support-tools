To run:
make all
./shell

Details:
For this shell, I used the structure and some of the functions provided by the tutorial shared in slack.
However, this code is much simpler than the code in the first set of examples, and while some of it was retyped from the tutorial I know what everything does. The annotations in the code are all mine.
