Note: The following internet resources were used to write these shells:

First shell program (shell-1.c): 
--------------------------------
Created a very basic shell in shell-1.c that displays the "$ " when the shell is started.

The user can type into the shell, but there are no commands that are understood by the shell.

Second shell program (shell-2.c):
---------------------------------
Built upon shell-1.c to create a slightly more advanced shell that can take in three different commands: cd, help, and exit. 

The command cd is very similar to the built-in command that we use to change directories. You can go up a directory or switch to a specific directory by specifying in the argument. 

The command help provides a brief explanation for the shell and provides the user with the three commands to use.

The exit command exits the shell.

In this shell, the user's current working directory is also printed above the command line.
