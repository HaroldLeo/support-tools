This is a far more complex version of shell program that I got from the YouTube video: https://youtu.be/k6TTj4C0LF0. I have modified to fit our project better, including hard coded eviz, lviz, wviz functions as well as some of my own that helps me to understand how the code works. It can run both system commands(limited amounts) as well built-in commands in the code. 

To run the program, type command: gcc -g shell.c -o trie-viz && ./trie-viz
